### Stats tutorials

#### Jupyter notebook tutorials

* [Sample posteriors with SVI in numpyro](https://gist.github.com/bmorris3/10a9a59352271a91873054be038aeb44)
  * In this example, we have an observed stellar spectrum that we would like to fit as a mixture of models for one cool and one hot stellar spectrum. We have two PHOENIX model stellar spectra which bracket the solar effective temperature, and a publicly available "observed" solar spectrum.
* [How to compute leave-one-out cross validation stats for a numpyro (jax) model with a Gaussian process from celerite2](https://gist.github.com/bmorris3/0557c13584c3fe321827eca788f37d02)
  * Based on the Leave-One-Out [article in the stan docs](https://mc-stan.org/loo/articles/loo2-non-factorizable.html)
* [Pareto smoothed importance sampling leave-one-out cross validation](https://gist.github.com/bmorris3/a69842ce9384966feba965eb0d726da6)
  * In this tutorial, we will construct a linear model with numpyro and carry out Pareto-Smoothed importance sampling Leave-One-Out Cross Validation on the results.
  * [These slides](https://speakerdeck.com/brettmorris/a-practical-introduction-to-leave-one-out-cross-validation) were part of the presentation of this notebook
* [Introduction to JAX+numpyro for physical scientists](https://github.com/bmorris3/jax-code-coffee/)
  * How (and why!) to get started with JAX and numpyro
